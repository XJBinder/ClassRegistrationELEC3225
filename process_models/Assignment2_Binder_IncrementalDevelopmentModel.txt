Incremental Development Model

1. Classes and their methods should be developed and tested first.
This is the backbone of our system and sets up a real framework for us to build
off of. We can test it one method at a time making sure that everything does what
it should to meet project requirements.

2. Next we should implement a database and give our back-end the ability to store
user and course data. This can be tested by sending the data from our back-end
Python program to whatever we decide to use as our database and manually
checking the database to confirm the data is being received.

3. Lastly, we need to create a nice user interface to separate the user from the
back-end Python program. We can test this by using the front-end program to
control the back-end. If we are able to use all the methods from the front-end and
send data to and from the database while meeting all project requirements the
system can be declared completed.
