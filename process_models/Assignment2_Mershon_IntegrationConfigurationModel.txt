Integration and Configuration Model


1. Finding Reusable Components:
o Database: Use MySQL or PostgreSQL for user and course management.
o User Interfaces: Utilize a web framework like Django or Flask.
o Scheduling Algorithms: Incorporate existing algorithms for conflict-free scheduling
if there are any.

2. Configuring Components:
o Set up the database for users and courses.
o Customize the web framework to handle user interactions and scheduling logic.

3. Integrate Components:
o Connect the database with the web application.

Rough Idea:

Database:
• MySQL: A popular open-source relational database management system that can be used
to manage the user and course data. Citation: MySQL Official Website

Web Framework:
• Django: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean,
pragmatic design. It is suitable for developing the user interfaces and backend logic of the
scheduling system. Citation: Django Project

Scheduling Algorithms:
• Utilizing existing algorithms for conflict-free scheduling, which can be integrated into the
system to manage course scheduling efficiently. Citation: Scheduling Algorithms in Python

User Interface Components:
• Bootstrap: A free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first
front-end web development. It can be used to design the user interfaces for students,
instructors, and admin. Citation: Bootstrap

Authentication and Authorization:
• OAuth2: An open standard for access delegation, commonly used to grant websites or
applications limited access to user information without exposing passwords. This can be
used to manage user authentication. Citation: OAuth 2.0
