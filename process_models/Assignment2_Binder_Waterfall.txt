Waterfall Method

1. Include system requirements from assignment description.

2. Figure out the best method to implement a database and store user and course
information. Make a blueprint for code including functions and what they do.
Design a model user interface for the system.

3. Implement the chosen database for user and course data, code classes with
functions that do tasks, and build a user interface with backend logic. We will
then test the system for any bugs that we can find.

4. Monitor for any issues or new feedback to streamline the project. Update the
system with any new requirements.
